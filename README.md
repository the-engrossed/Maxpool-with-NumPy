# Maxpool-with-NumPy

This program is for the following problem statement:
Given and nxn matrix the matrix will be divided into smaller windows of size mxm, where m <= n/2.
Now, the maximum elements from the smaller windows are pooled together to form a matrix of mxm.
This new matrix will contain the elements which are the maximum values of the smaller windows.

There are two methods, one where I have defined to functin to perform the above problem statement. It generates a random 4x4 matrix, and performs the opertations on that matrix.
The other method which is a more generalized scenario, the problem statement is generalized, where a user shall enter number rows, columns,and elements.
And also give the pooling matrix size. For example for 4x4 matrix, we can divide the matrix in 2x2 smaller windows of which max elements are stored in 2x2 matrix.

Please go through the code if you find it useful.

# Maxpool-with-NumPy

This program is for the following problem statement:
Given and nxn matrix the matrix will be divided into smaller windows of size mxm, where m <= n/2.
Now, the maximum elements from the smaller windows are pooled together to form a matrix of mxm.
This new matrix will contain the elements which are the maximum values of the smaller windows.
